# Sparkify User Churn Prediction

Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project


Sparkify is a fictional music streaming app created by Udacity. 
For this project we are given application data of sizes mini, medium and large. 
To make this project happen, we need machine learning solutions that are not only accurate, 
but also powerful enough to process large data fast, so I have used mini scale data (128 mb) 
that I have processed with Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data.
